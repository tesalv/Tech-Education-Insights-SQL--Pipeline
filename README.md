# Tech Education Insights: Exploring Pathways into the Tech World

Welcome to the **Tech Education Insights** project! This data analysis endeavor delves into the world of technology education, aiming to provide valuable insights into the journey of entering the tech industry. By collecting and analyzing data from three different tech schools, we seek to answer critical questions that aspiring tech enthusiasts often ponder: What are the best entry points? How do students navigate their education? What factors influence success in the tech world?

## Project Overview

This project focuses on data collection and analysis from three distinct tech schools. Through web scraping and data extraction techniques, we gather information about various aspects of these schools, including student feedback, course choices, attendance preferences, time commitments, curriculum influence, and more. Our goal is to uncover patterns and trends that shed light on the most effective pathways for entering the tech industry.

## Data Collection

We employ web scraping methodologies to gather data from three different tech schools. The collected data encompasses a range of attributes, such as school details, course information, student feedback, attendance preferences, and more. Our commitment to data accuracy ensures that the insights drawn from this analysis are reliable and informative.

## Analysis Queries

The following are the primary topics we explore through our analysis queries:

- **Average Rate of Each School:** We calculate and compare the average ratings of each tech school, providing an overview of the perceived quality of education.

- **Student Feedback:** Do students tend to provide feedback? We delve into the feedback trends to understand how engaged students are in sharing their opinions.

- **Preferred Courses:** Analyzing the courses chosen by students offers insight into their interests and the skills they prioritize.

- **Most Rated Courses:** By identifying the most rated courses, we highlight the subjects that resonate the most with students.

- **Attendance Type:** We examine the choice between online and in-person attendance, revealing preferences and potential influences.

- **Time Commitment:** Understanding the time commitment choice between full-time and part-time studies sheds light on the flexibility of different pathways.

- **Influence of "Curriculum" and "Job Support":** We explore whether the presence of a strong curriculum and job support program impacts student experiences.

- **Anonymity Influence:** Does anonymity affect student feedback? We analyze whether anonymous feedback differs from identifiable feedback.

- **Evolution of Scores Over Years:** By tracking the evolution of scores over time, we identify trends in the perceived quality of education.
